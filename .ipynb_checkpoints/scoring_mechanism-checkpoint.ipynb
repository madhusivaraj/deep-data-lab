    "ap1 ='We bought a brand new set of AirPods for 159. After using them for a week, I was listening to them and the right air pod went dead. I figured, maybe I just need to charge them. So when I got home I charged them, and the next day I went to use them again and the right air bud was still dead. So I did some research, tried to reset them, and then I couldnt reconnect them to my phone at all. Once I contacted Apple, they tried to give us the run around. They wanted us to let them fully die, which makes sense, so we did that. Then, when they still didnt work we wanted to exchange the faulty pair for a new set (BECAUSE WE PAID 159 DOLLARS AND ONLY USED THEM FOR A WEEK). Keep in mind, they were taken care of, not dropped, no water damage, they were expensive so they were treated delicately. Apple wanted a 180 deposit to get a new set, which is MORE THAN WHAT I ORIGINALLY PAID FOR. I decided to contact Amazon, and they suggested contacting Apple, but once I explained what was going, on Amazon offered to make things right and send out a replacement. Never had an issue with Amazon customer service, but Apple was extremely disappointing. I wont purchase these again.' \n",

A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say Hey Siri to activate your favorite personal assistant. Plus, when youre on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency. Additionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge, and theyre made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time. Just 15 minutes in the case gives you three hours of listening to time or up to two hours of talk time. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy\"\n",
