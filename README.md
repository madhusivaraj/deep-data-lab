## Description
Empathy is a central part of our lives and leads to communication and cooperation, transcending social interactions, behaviors, and well-being. An AI system with a capacity for empathy could provide more natural interactions while making judgments that take moods and feelings into account. I built a scoring mechanism to quantify different emotions based on data-driven methods, including word vectors and corpora. Inspired by Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, I created a system to score various Amazon reviews on a scale of 0 to 1 for all relevant categories from the comprehensive list in the default LIWC2015 dictionary.

### Run
