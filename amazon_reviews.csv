0,Apple AirPods with Charging Case,"We bought a brand new set of AirPods for 159. After using them for a week, I was listening to them and the right air pod went dead. I figured, maybe I just need to charge them. So when I got home I charged them, and the next day I went to use them again and the right air bud was still dead. So I did some research, tried to reset them, and then I couldnt reconnect them to my phone at all. Once I contacted Apple, they tried to give us the run around. They wanted us to let them fully die, which makes sense, so we did that. Then, when they still didnt work we wanted to exchange the faulty pair for a new set (BECAUSE WE PAID 159 DOLLARS AND ONLY USED THEM FOR A WEEK). Keep in mind, they were taken care of, not dropped, no water damage, they were expensive so they were treated delicately. Apple wanted a 180 deposit to get a new set, which is MORE THAN WHAT I ORIGINALLY PAID FOR. I decided to contact Amazon, and they suggested contacting Apple, but once I explained what was going, on Amazon offered to make things right and send out a replacement. Never had an issue with Amazon customer service, but Apple was extremely disappointing. I wont purchase these again.","[('First pers plural', 0.032325493699025404), ('Total function words', 0.31475411575015133), ('Prepositions', 0.054465100510835814), ('Causation', 0.02654867256637168), ('Comparisons', 0.017699115044247787), ('Total pronouns', 0.03982300884955752), ('First pers singular', 0.05752212389380531), ('Hear', 0.004424778761061947), ('Conjunctions', 0.05752212389380531), ('Motion', 0.015396594352023887), ('Time', 0.008849557522123894), ('Tentative', 0.004424778761061947), ('Interrogatives', 0.017699115044247787), ('Past focus', 0.01327433628318584), ('Differentiation', 0.004424778761061947), ('Ingestion', 0.017699115044247787), ('Third pers plural', 0.035398230088495575), ('Articles', 0.01327433628318584), ('Space', 0.004424778761061947), ('Negations', 0.008849557522123894), ('Present focus', 0.004424778761061947), ('Auxiliary verbs', 0.004424778761061947), ('Impersonal pronouns', 0.004424778761061947)]"
1,Apple AirPods with Charging Case,"These AirPods are amazing they automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out. A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say Hey Siri to activate your favorite personal assistant. Plus, when youre on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency. Additionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge, and theyre made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time. Just 15 minutes in the case gives you three hours of listening to time or up to two hours of talk time. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy","[('Impersonal pronouns', 0.006211180124223602), ('Total function words', 0.3710216546676471), ('Present focus', 0.012422360248447204), ('Third pers plural', 0.018633540372670808), ('Prepositions', 0.0610930502120442), ('Future focus', 0.006211180124223602), ('Second person', 0.048576977060678386), ('Total pronouns', 0.012422360248447204), ('Space', 0.012422360248447204), ('Conjunctions', 0.024844720496894408), ('Interrogatives', 0.018633540372670808), ('Reward', 0.006211180124223602), ('Hear', 0.024844720496894408), ('Auxiliary verbs', 0.006211180124223602), ('Time', 0.006211180124223602), ('Social processes', 0.011201012732048913), ('Articles', 0.006211180124223602), ('Quantifiers', 0.006211180124223602), ('Causation', 0.006211180124223602), ('Comparisons', 0.006211180124223602), ('Numbers', 0.006211180124223602), ('First pers singular', 0.006211180124223602), ('Discrepancy', 0.006211180124223602), ('Perceptual processes', 0.00463273943809684)]"
2,NutriBullet,"Very loud! I didn't think noise would ever be an issue but this is WAY louder than any blender I’ve owned in the past.

The smaller sized cups are so tall with just a tiny blade at the bottom, I can never get it to blend my ingredients - so basically they are useless.

3,NutriBullet,"This is my third NB purchase and by far the most impressive product. The first two were 600 and 900 watts, which lasted about 3 years each when the motors burned out. I assume this was because of filling too close to the lines. This model has several improvements, including multiple speeds and functions, an actual blender, plus the 32 and 24 oz cups for smoothies; it is quieter and more high tech. The old style cup had rubber gaskets that were inset and fouled if not very carefully cleaned by removing them. The new cups have eliminated this problem.
